	Abstract = {
This paper links the analysis of IP address policy to the established vocabulary and concepts of institutional economics. Internet addressing and routing are usually discussed in technical terms, yet embedded in this highly technical discourse are a number of critical economic concepts, such as scarcity, externalities, common pool resources, tragedy of the commons, and conflict over the distribution of costs. To solve these problems, governance institutions native to the Internet have evolved. Yet despite the centrality of addressing and routing to Internet governance, there is very little research literature that bridges economic, institutional and technical discussions of IP addressing and routing. This paper connects the techno-economic discussion to analysis of institutions and governance arrangements.},

@inproceedings{Zhao:2010vn,
	Abstract = {The rapid growth of global routing tables has raised concerns among many Internet Service Providers. The most immediate concern regarding routing scalability is the size of the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), which seems to be growing at a faster pace than router hardware can support. This paper focuses on one potential solution to this problem - FIB aggregation, i.e., aggregating FIB entries without affecting the forwarding paths taken by data traffic. Compared with alternative solutions to the routing scalability problem, FIB aggregation is particularly appealing because it is a purely local software optimization limited within a router, requiring no changes to routing protocols or router hardware. To understand the feasibility of using FIB aggregation to extend router lifetime, we present several FIB aggregation algorithms and evaluate their performance using routing tables and updates from tens of networks. We find that FIB aggregation can reduce the FIB table size by as much as 70% with small computational overhead. We also show that the computational overhead can be controlled through various mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {In today's Internet, users can choose their local Internet service providers (ISPs), but once their packets have entered the network, they have little control over the overall routes their packets take. Giving a user the ability to choose between provider-level routes has the potential of fostering ISP competition to offer enhanced service and improving end-to-end performance and reliability. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a new Internet routing architecture (NIRA) that gives a user the ability to choose the sequence of providers his packets take. NIRA addresses a broad range of issues, including practical provider compensation, scalable route discovery, efficient route representation, fast route fail-over, and security. NIRA supports user choice without running a global link-state routing protocol. It breaks an end-to-end route into a sender part and a receiver part and uses address assignment to represent each part. A user can specify a route with only a source and a destination address, and switch routes by switching addresses. We evaluate NIRA using a combination of network measurement, simulation, and analysis. Our evaluation shows that NIRA supports user choice with low overhead.},

	Abstract = {Companies seeking to ensure that their Internet connection is resilient often purchase services from multiple providers. This leads them inexorably towards having their IP address range visible in the global routing table, increasing the resource usage of every Internet router. Since this is essentially `free', yet impacts the cost and stability of every router in the world, this is a classic `tragedy of the commons'. There is little prospect of change in the IPv4 world, but there is a chance to fix the problem as IPv6 is rolled out. Unfortunately, SHIM6, the engineering solution chosen to solve this issue in IPv6, will only be effective if universally adopted, and there are no short-term incentives to prefer SHIM6 over a duplication of the IPv4 arrangements. Incentives could be artificially introduced by requiring payment for adding multi-homed address space to the global routing table --- a na{\"\i}ve estimate of the actual cost being $77 000 per routing prefix. However, it would be almost impossible to ensure the substantial revenues involved are correctly redistributed to those bearing the costs.},
