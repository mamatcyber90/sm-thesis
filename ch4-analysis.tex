\subsection{Interpretation}

In spite of seeing aggregation behavior relative to the control, the total number of routes in the routing table does not drop over time, suggesting that old people are replaced by new ``bad guys'' or new entrants. Cittadini's study suggests that the proportion of ``bad guys'' remains the same over time (the people that would show up on the CIDR Report), suggesting the rolling-over bad guy theory.

OR. The table just grew less quickly than it otherwise could have, but we can't examine the counterfactual world...?

Rolling-over bad guy theory would be supported by the rate of growth of new ASes on teh CIDR report?

Arthur suggests looking at the fraction (# of /24s / # of prefixes in the routing table) per AS or for the entire routing table, over time

What do Cittadini's observations mean for my analysis of the later repport where people are far more deaggregated

\subsection{Validity}
It was an oversight that I didn't measure behavior of ASes before their appearance on the CIDR Reprot. However, because appearance is determined based on netgain behavior means this is likely as not as huge a challenge to validity as I expected. I still need to be concerned that appearance didn't occur because someone else got less bad, but in such a case one's aggregation fraction would be at best flat, not decreasing to start (or they should've appeared earlier).

%- Available data/data overview
%	- plot 'h' plots of available data
%	- plot total prefixes in the total table (Routeviews) and in the report (Cidr Report) to see that there aren't any discontinuities
%
%- Accuracy/error of my implementation of the CIDR report
%
%- Visualization of aggregate behavior and general characteristics (in particular stratification at the top of the CIDR report)
%    - Definition of metrics used in the analysis
%        - rank on CIDR Report (order by netgain)
%        - absolute/delta netgain
%        - relative/delta netgain (relative to netsnow)
%    - CDFs by AS appearnace
%    - CDFs by rank
%
%    - Summary/general statistics and characteristics of behavior over time (time series?), across and within groups, etc. (p62)
%
%- AS Behavior after appearing on the CIDR Report
%	- Distribution of AS behaviors from T=0, T=+1 month, 3 m, 6m, 1y, 2y, etc.
%		- all appearances on the cidr report
%		- no appearance/randomly selected control
%		- appearances that actually had behavior changes observed
%	- slice by date (NOT by rank on CIDR report), and by netsnow
%
%- Variance in views of data from different peers
