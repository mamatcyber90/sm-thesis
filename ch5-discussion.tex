% THE ENTIRE AND SOLE POINT OF THE DISCUSSION SECTION SHOULD BE TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS AS TO WHETHER THE CIDR REPORT EVER WAS EFFECTIVE AND THEN, BASED ON THE OBSERVED CHANGES, WHETHER IT BECAME LESS EFFECTIVE OR WHETHER SOMETHING ELSE CAUSED THE OBSERVED BEHAVIORAL CHANGE

What may have caused the changes observed?

\section{Changing benefits of routing deaggregation}
\section{Changing costs of routing deaggregation and appearing on the CIDR Report}
\section{Changing community norms and responses}

% OR conversely
% 1) quality of signal
% 2) response to signal

The challenge of agreeing to supply an institution that does anything more than provide information (i.e. sanctions) multilaterally is potentially problematic in looking beyond the CIDR Report.

\fbox{Look at Tony Li's interview again}

\section{Was the CIDR Report successful?}
- counterfactual plots
\section{What is aggregable or not?}
\section{What is acceptable deaggreation?}
``good'' vs. ``bad'' deaggregation.
