%Is routing table growth still a problem? If you conclude yes, then by all accounts it will be more difficult to coordinate our way out of the next routing table growth ceiling. When you compare BGP3->BGP4 (although they were somewhat compatible) to IPv4->IPv6, the progress on the former is relatively incredible. While this may be because of the relatively greater pain that was being experienced at the time (that we haven't yet seen in IPv4), it seems like a reasonable conclusion all the same.

%We'll need to coordinate again in some way, but how do we do that?
%- switch protocols?
%- economic solutions
%- improve social/CPR governance?
%  - need to be able to answer questions about what is "fair"? ("know it when you see it?")
%  - would something like a routing table governance council actually allow continued enjoyment of the dynamic aspects of internet routing?
%  - need sanctions (see what else ostrom has to say about this)
%    - how do you actually do this? routing, but there is a problem of adoption and market power and who has influence


\section{Future Work}
Measure pre-treatment behavior (behavior before appearance i.e. T-30days...) to see if behavior changed, rather than
Use stronger statistical measures
