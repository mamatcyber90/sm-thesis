\noindent
This thesis is set in 12 point Times New Roman, and was typeset with \LaTeX{}
using a modified version of the MIT thesis class\footnote{
\url{http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/reference/thesis/tex/}}.
The bibliography and citations were managed using {{\sc Bib}\TeX} with the help
of BibDesk. Chris Monson's \LaTeX{} Makefile\footnote{
\url{http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/}} was used to automate the thesis
build process and to produce PDF output files.
\\

\noindent
All figures (except those included from other sources) were created with R or
GraphViz and output as PDFs for inclusion by \LaTeX{}. One figure was augmented
with Adobe Illustrator.
\\

\noindent
The analysis and data presented in this thesis were generated with the help of
R, PostgreSQL, tools written in Python, and a number of the GNU Coreutils
utility programs, in addition to the tools mentioned in the body of the thesis
(straightenRV, libbgpdump, etc.).
\\

\noindent
Source code for the analysis tools and the thesis were managed using Git and
GitHub\footnote{\url{github.com}}. Source files were edited using SubEthaEdit,
Vim and jEdit.
\\

\noindent
An Apple MacBook and a Lenovo Thinkpad X200, running Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu
10.10 respectively, were the primary systems used to produce this thesis. A
large multi-core system with many gigabytes of memory and terabytes of disk
array running Debian Squeeze was used for data processing.
